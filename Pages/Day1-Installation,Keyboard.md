# [⌂](/README.md) Day 1 - Installation, keyboard setup 

05:45 - Nice cold morning, dark everywhere  
05:50 - Matej's alarm is ringing  
06:12 - Taking the bus to train station  
06:41 - Taking 4 hour train ride to pick up the laptop  
10:51 - Exiting train  
11:05 - Holding Mac in my hands

I can start my way back ...

So, I bought a Macbook second-hand. There are no scratches on the display, but there are small ones on the body of the Mac. 
Let's set it up and test the laptop.

## Installation

The setup of the laptop is straightforward and really simple to follow. The only hard part was logging in to my Apple ID. I selected the Slovak keyboard layout, but I soon realized it was not the same 
as Windows. Thank you, Apple.  
I managed to log in by searching for the symbol and copying it to the input field.
But for the rest, I didn't have any problems with it.

During the process, it asked me about migration from another computer, but I didn't have 
my old one with me. So, I skipped this step. **It was the worst mistake I could have made.**

### Migration of data from another device
My previous laptop is Windows, so I needed to install the Migration tool to move the data to the 
Mac. I would like to kindly say to everyone not to Migrate after your computer is set up.
I tested it, and I have several problems with the process:
1. You can't use the Mac while the data are being moved, even though it can take several hours to finish
2. When you copy user data, it always creates a new user in the system instead of copying data to a specific one

So, after realizing this issue, I decided that I would manually copy the data from one computer to the other.
In case of still using the migration tool, you can copy the data to `/Users/Shared` and use it from there,
but you need to do it manually. There is no setup from Apple.

## Keyboard Layout
19:25 - Arriving back in my town  
19:42 - Arriving home  
20:02 - Setting up laptop keyboard layout so I can code on it

On Windows, I was used to using the Slovak keyboard for coding, mainly because you have almost all the special symbols for coding in the main row. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key#South_Slavic_Latin_and_Czech_keyboards)
So, I decided to modify the default Slovak macOS layout using the Ukulele tool.
- The Windows layout:  https://kbdlayout.info/KBDSL/
You can check the output:
