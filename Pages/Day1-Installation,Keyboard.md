## Installation

## Keyboard Layout
On Windows i was used to use Slovak keyboard for coding, mainly because you have almost all the special symbols for coding in the main row. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key#South_Slavic_Latin_and_Czech_keyboards)
So I decided to modify the default Slovak Mac OS layout using Ukulele tool.
- The Windows layout:  https://kbdlayout.info/KBDSL/
You can check the output:
