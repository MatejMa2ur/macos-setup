# [⌂](/README.md) Day 1 - Installation, keyboard setup 

05:45 - Nice cold morning, dark everywhere  
05:50 - Matej's alarm is ringing  
06:12 - Taking bus to train station  
06:41 - Taking 4 hour train ride to pickup the laptop  
10:51 - Exiting train  
11:05 - Holding Mac in my hands

I can start my way back ...

So I bought Macbook from second hand, no scratches on display, but small ones on the body of th Mac. 
Let's set it up and test the laptop.

## Installation

The setup of the laptop is straightforward and really simple to follow, only hard part was for me 
to log in to my AppleId. I selected Slovak keyboard layout, but I soon realized it is not the same 
as Windows. Thank you, Apple.  
I managed to log in, with searching for the symbol and copying it to the input field.
But for the rest I didn't had any problems with it.

During the process it asked me about migration from another computer, but I didn't have 
my old one with me. So I skipped this step, **Worst mistake I could have done.**

### Migration of data from other device
My previous laptop is Windows, so I needed to install the Migration tool to move the data to the 
Mac. I would like to kindly say to everyone do not Migrate after your computer is set up.
I tested it and I have several problems with the process:
1. You can't use the mac while the data are being moved, even though it can take several hours to finish
2. When you copy user data it always creates new user in the system, instead of copying data to specific one

So after realizing this issues, I decided that I will manually copy the data from one computer to the other.
In case of still using the migration tool, you can copy the data to `/Users/Shared` and use it from there,
but you need to do it manually, there is no setup from Apple.

## Keyboard Layout
19:25 - Arriving back to my town  
19:42 - Arriving home  
20:02 - Setting up laptop keyboard layout, so I can code on it

On Windows I was used to use Slovak keyboard for coding, mainly because you have almost all the special symbols for coding in the main row. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key#South_Slavic_Latin_and_Czech_keyboards)
So I decided to modify the default Slovak macOS layout using Ukulele tool.
- The Windows layout:  https://kbdlayout.info/KBDSL/
You can check the output:
