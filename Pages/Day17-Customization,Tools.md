# [⌂](/README.md) Day 7 - Customization, Tools (Power Toys)

07:20 - Woke up  
07:30 - Made breakfast  

18:00 - Did some calls  
18:50 - I can't continue working on default Mac apps  
18:55 - Let's customize the Mac

Let's do it...

I have been a Windows user for a long time. I know it's downsides and a lot of tools, which you can use to make it easier, one of them called: [Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)

These are a lot of cool tools, which you can use for helping you with a lot of tasks, as coder, designer, or basic user.
I focused on some of them to make them work on my computer.

## Color picker

For the color picker I chose application called [Pika](https://superhighfives.com/pika).
I like to create designs, and implement them into websites and to make it easier, it is helpful to use Color picker, which will allow you to select the color from any image you see on the screen and use this color when you need it afterwards.  
There are really simple settings, and I recommend turning on: `Automatically copy color to clipboard on pick.`

### Keybinding

And to make it as comfy as I am used to, I am using shortcut: `option`+`shift`+`c`


## FancyZones - Window Manager

For Window Manager I thought I would write more right now, but I am still searching for some good one which will help me split the screen and maintan gaps, between the windows.

# Other tools worth mentioning

## Terminal

For terminal I found **Warp**, but you need to be logged in to use it, I do not like it.
I am going to try to find some alternative.

## Clipboard

For clipboard I found **Maccy**, really simple clipboard which allow you to have saved multiple items in clipboard, so you can continue working without worrying about losing the copied data.
