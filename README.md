I Bought Mac.

# MacOS-setup
For people who are used to Windows and want to continue using Mac as Windows they are used to I am going to write down few points how you can do it.

I will extend it based on how I use the keyboard, and what was more comfy for me to do.

## Keyboard Layout
On Windows i was used to use Slovak keyboard for coding, mainly because you have almost all the special symbols for coding in the main row. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key#South_Slavic_Latin_and_Czech_keyboards)
So I decided to modify the default Slovak Mac OS layout using Ukulele tool.

You can check the output:
